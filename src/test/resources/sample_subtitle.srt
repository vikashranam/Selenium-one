[man 3] You're safe back in Mexico.

00:01:57,367 --> 00:01:59,494
[man 4] Punisher comes to Juarez,
we'll kill his ass.

Oh, shit, I'm the only one left?

No, I'm good. I'm good.
Yeah, about to board.

You won. You... you killed everyone.

The bikers, the cartels,
the Kitchen Irish... they're all gone.

-I don't.

What are you gonna do?

78
00:09:55,261 --> 00:09:56,929
Hey, what's the story with you, man?

79
00:09:58,305 --> 00:10:00,099
Here early, here late.

80
00:10:01,392 --> 00:10:04,520
You know if they don't ask you to work
extra, they don't pay you for it, right?

81
00:10:04,604 --> 00:10:06,939
-[Paulie] Right?
-But you knew that, right?

82
00:10:08,733 --> 00:10:10,109
You got a tongue in your head?

83
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,862
I don't know what your deal is, man.

84
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:16,240
I'm guessing, uh, "elevator don't go
up to the penthouse" type thing.

85

-[all laughing]
-Hey, whatever, right?

86
00:10:18,826 --> 00:10:23,122
But this shit you do, that's hurting us.

87
00:10:23,873 --> 00:10:26,042
Because of you,
we're getting less overtime.

88
00:10:26,125 --> 00:10:28,210
Kick his ass, Lance.
Maybe he'd understand that.

89
00:10:28,294 --> 00:10:30,212
Wise up, window licker.

90
00:10:30,296 --> 00:10:32,464

-Why don't we make it interesting?
-[Donny] Yo!

96
00:11:04,664 --> 00:11:05,957
[stammers] I would whup your butt.

97

-Put money on it.
-All right.

98
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:09,293
-Fifty. Hundred.
-Oh, big talk. Big talk.

99
00:11:09,376 --> 00:11:10,962
-Where you going?
-I'm gonna whup your ass.

100
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:12,088
[Leo] Easy money.

101
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,297

-Can I come?

102
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,383
-No room.

This is high, man. Shit.

107
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:45,162
I'm Donny.

109
00:11:49,083 --> 00:11:51,085
You can see forever up here, huh?

[grunting]

111
00:11:57,049 --> 00:11:58,717
-This why you come up here?
-Hmm.

112
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,097
I come up here because no one else does.

113
00:12:05,016 --> 00:12:06,017
Yeah.

114
00:12:08,895 --> 00:12:10,354
[Frank sighs]

115
00:12:10,437 --> 00:12:11,730
Pete, right?

116
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:20,031
Well, Pete, my grandma makes
the best sandwich in the five boroughs.

117
00:12:20,614 --> 00:12:23,242
And you ain't gonna know that
unless you try one.

118
00:12:31,125 --> 00:12:34,045
Come on, man. A man's gotta eat.

119
00:12:34,128 --> 00:12:36,505
Especially the way you're throwing
that hammer. [chuckles]

120
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:38,674
Like Cool Hand Luke or something.

121
00:12:38,757 --> 00:12:40,759
One-man chain gang.
You like that movie?

122
00:12:40,843 --> 00:12:43,137
I take one of those sandwiches,
you stop talking?

123
00:12:43,220 --> 00:12:44,221
[chuckles]

124
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:46,307
No promises.

125
00:12:47,308 --> 00:12:48,434
[chuckles]

126
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:53,355
Appreciate it.

127
00:12:55,316 --> 00:12:56,483
You know...

128
00:12:58,861 --> 00:13:00,612
everyone thinks you're a retard.

129
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:05,367
But I knew you wasn't.

130
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:11,332
Lance shouldn't have done that, man.

131
00:13:11,415 --> 00:13:14,251
Everyone's just worried
about making money, that's all.

132
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:17,588
Shit, I could use the overtime myself.

133
00:13:17,671 --> 00:13:20,799
I ain't worked in a while
and I gotta pay for my grandma's meds.

134
00:13:28,307 --> 00:13:30,142
Those are some serious scars, man.

135
00:13:32,436 --> 00:13:34,146
-That one a bullet hole?
-Yeah.

136
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,272
Shit.

137
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:38,192
You some sort of secret badass, Pete?

138
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:41,820
-Marine Corps.
-Yeah?

139
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:42,780
Yeah.

140
00:13:43,530 --> 00:13:44,823
My pa was in the corps.

141
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,494
Yeah. In the 1/2 down in North Carolina.

142
00:13:48,994 --> 00:13:51,330
He was like a superhero to me
or something.

143
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:54,500
Except they don't die, right?

144
00:13:56,127 --> 00:13:57,211
[Frank mutters]

145
00:13:58,128 --> 00:13:59,338
I'm sorry to hear that.

146
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:03,092
My pa, he served three tours.

147
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:06,845
Iraq twice, Afghanistan.

148
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:12,935
Then him and my ma were coming back
from a movie one night...

149
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:16,856
and got clipped by some kid
who had just passed his driving test.

150
00:14:20,317 --> 00:14:22,444
I woke up the next morning,
they were just gone.

151
00:14:26,032 --> 00:14:27,783
[sighs] You got family?

152
00:14:29,826 --> 00:14:31,037
I was 12.

153
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:34,790
I had to come up here,
live with my grandma.

154
00:14:36,750 --> 00:14:38,335
She's the only person I got left.

155
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,964
[Lisa]  Dad, look.

156
00:14:43,299 --> 00:14:44,884
[voice fading] It's hard...

157
00:14:49,846 --> 00:14:52,391
...took the fall
for some guys I hung out with...

158
00:14:54,351 --> 00:14:55,811
but I never gave 'em up.

159
00:14:57,813 --> 00:14:59,606
Semper Fi,  right?

160
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:03,777
Look, Donny. Thanks for the sandwich.
You know, I... appreciate that.

161
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:07,239
But I'm not looking for a pal, yeah?

162
00:15:09,533 --> 00:15:12,786
Whatever it is you're looking for...
I'm not it.

163
00:15:15,164 --> 00:15:17,499
Yeah... okay.

164
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:21,253
[Curtis]  There's a story I heard.

165
00:15:21,837 --> 00:15:23,672
There's a soldier in a hole
and he can't get out,

166
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:24,965
so he yells for help.

167
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:29,511
An NCO comes by and says,
"Suck it up, son. Dig deep."

168
00:15:29,803 --> 00:15:31,055
And gives the soldier a shovel.

169
00:15:32,431 --> 00:15:35,309
The soldier does as he's told
and digs that hole deeper.

170
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,769
Then an officer comes by,

171
00:15:37,853 --> 00:15:41,065
says, "Hell, son, use the tools
your NCO gave you."

172
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,983
And throws him a bucket.

173
00:15:43,359 --> 00:15:46,988
So the trooper in the hole
uses the shovel to fill that bucket,

174
00:15:47,071 --> 00:15:48,906
and the hole was deeper still, right?

175
00:15:49,490 --> 00:15:53,995
Next up, psychiatrist comes by
and offers him drugs, tells him,

176
00:15:54,078 --> 00:15:56,705
"This is gonna help you
forget about the hole."

177
00:15:56,788 --> 00:15:57,957
And they do.

178
00:15:58,958 --> 00:16:00,376
But then the pills run out.

179
00:16:00,960 --> 00:16:03,545
Then a soldier comes up,
a guy just like him,

180
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:07,216
covered in mud and dirt,
and he hears the yells for help.

181
00:16:08,092 --> 00:16:10,719
And that filthy soldier
jumps down in the hole, too.

182
00:16:10,802 --> 00:16:12,388
And the kid, he freaks out.

183
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:15,641
"What are you doing?
Now we're both stuck in a hole."

184
00:16:16,808 --> 00:16:18,852
And the filthy soldier just smiles...

185
00:16:19,811 --> 00:16:22,982
and says, "Calm down, buddy.
I've been here before.

186
00:16:24,233 --> 00:16:25,442
I know how to get out."

187
00:16:27,152 --> 00:16:29,488
Got a couple of new faces in here today.

188
00:16:29,655 --> 00:16:30,656
Welcome.

189
00:16:30,947 --> 00:16:33,200
If you wanna talk, talk.

190
00:16:33,284 --> 00:16:35,995
If you just wanna listen,
that's all good, too.

191
00:16:36,078 --> 00:16:38,914
No judgment here,
just brothers and sisters who understand.

192
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:41,667
Only thing you've got to understand
is the world isn't changing.

193
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,920
The real persecuted minority
in this country today...

194
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:50,634
-is the Christian American patriot.
-Oh, here we go with the same bullshit.

195
00:16:50,718 --> 00:16:54,096
You're blind, asshole.
Don't rag on me because I can see.

196
00:16:54,179 --> 00:16:55,389
Kiss my ass, cracker.

197
00:16:55,472 --> 00:16:58,850
Isaac, let O'Connor finish his piece,
the same way you do

198
00:16:58,934 --> 00:17:01,437
when we get a blow-by-blow account
of your week's titty bar action.

199
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,897
-[all chuckle]
-Blow-by-blow is right.

200
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:09,570
We've got to do something
about the liberal, do-gooding assholes

201
00:17:09,653 --> 00:17:11,822
who are running this country
into the ground.

202
00:17:11,905 --> 00:17:14,283
The ones who want to take
our rights and our guns.

203
00:17:16,202 --> 00:17:17,578
Anyone else got a take?

204
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:24,543
I just know that I fought for this country
and that it's got no place for me.

205
00:17:27,796 --> 00:17:30,674
I don't know what the rules
are anymore, you know?

206
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,344
They're scared, man.
Because they aren't stupid.

207
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:39,015
They spent 15 years training an army
and then abandoned it on the streets.

208
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:42,103
A time is gonna come
when we have to defend ourselves

209
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,605
and... and put things back
to how they were.

210
00:17:44,688 --> 00:17:47,066
You love this country,
you better be ready,

211
00:17:47,149 --> 00:17:48,859
'cause the next war's gonna be here.

212
00:17:49,901 --> 00:17:52,404
Blood will flow in the streets.

213
00:17:52,488 --> 00:17:54,740
Sic semper tyrannis.

214
00:17:55,449 --> 00:17:57,118
"Thus always to tyrants"?

215
00:17:58,952 --> 00:18:01,247
You really think our governments
are tyrants, Lewis?

216
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:09,963
All I know is that we risked our lives
and we did terrible things...

217
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:12,258
and it meant nothing when we got home.

218
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,887
[indistinct chatter]

219
00:18:24,228 --> 00:18:26,021
How you sleeping, Lewis?

220
00:18:26,105 --> 00:18:30,066
Uh, better. I work a lot but, uh, better.

221
00:18:30,817 --> 00:18:32,111
Group helps.

222
00:18:34,196 --> 00:18:36,157
I've been reading a lot.

223
00:18:38,284 --> 00:18:39,576
Perspective is good.

224
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:41,703
-Mmm-hmm.
-But...

225
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:45,040
the answers have to be your own.

226
00:18:47,459 --> 00:18:50,921
You have to take an honest look in here
before we look anywhere else.

227
00:18:51,838 --> 00:18:52,839
All right?

228
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,053
I'll see you next time.

229
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,472
Take care of yourself, Lewis.

230
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,363
[Frank] Was a good meeting, Curt.

231
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:20,117
There he is.

232
00:19:20,409 --> 00:19:23,620
-You good?
-I'm copacetic, Frank. You?

233
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,165
Oh, yeah. Great.

234
00:19:26,415 --> 00:19:28,625
-It's been a while.
-Yeah, I'm a slow reader.

235
00:19:28,709 --> 00:19:29,585
Yeah.

236
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:32,003
-I appreciate it.
-Right.

237
00:19:32,087 --> 00:19:33,255
I really enjoyed it.

238
00:19:34,465 --> 00:19:35,507
Like I told Lewis...

239
00:19:37,509 --> 00:19:40,971
books are great,
but they don't hold all the answers.

240
00:19:42,055 --> 00:19:44,140
-Can I get some coffee?
-Help yourself.

241
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:47,186
Lewis drives a cab all night.

242
00:19:48,354 --> 00:19:50,272
I don't think it's a coincidence, either.

243
00:19:50,356 --> 00:19:54,025
I suspect he talks to himself
in the mirror.

244
00:19:55,277 --> 00:19:59,240
And that's part of the problem, Frank.
Nobody wants to be themselves anymore.

245
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:05,120
Internet, social media,
goddamn talent shows for assholes...

246
00:20:06,247 --> 00:20:08,790
Everybody wants to be somebody else.

247
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,210
Nobody...

248
00:20:12,669 --> 00:20:16,757
is happy just to look at themselves
in the mirror, see themselves.

249
00:20:16,840 --> 00:20:19,384
Then it means they don't have
to be responsible either.

250
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,221
So what about you, Frank?

251
00:20:23,138 --> 00:20:24,723
What is it gonna take to make you happy?

252
00:20:26,183 --> 00:20:28,101
Come on. "Happy"?

253
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,146
Happy is a kick in the balls
waiting to happen.

254
00:20:32,105 --> 00:20:33,940
So you kick yourself in the balls first.

255
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,442
[scoffs]

256
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,695
That's crazy, Lieutenant.
[chuckles] Look...

257
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:42,324
you got half a life left to live,
my friend.

258
00:20:42,616 --> 00:20:45,160
If you don't, you might as well be dead.

259
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:48,955
-Oh, I am dead, Curtis. You didn't hear?
-Bullshit.

260
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,375
You got a name, a passport,
as I recall...

261
00:20:52,293 --> 00:20:53,460
Frank Castle's dead.

262
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:57,548
Pete Castiglione... he's got a life.

263
00:20:58,214 --> 00:21:02,678
Anybody that had anything to do with what
happened to Maria and the kids are dead.

264
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:06,014
Mission accomplished.
And I don't have a problem with that.

265
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:08,099
Hell, if you would've asked me,
I woulda helped you.

266
00:21:08,183 --> 00:21:09,225
I know that.

267
00:21:10,352 --> 00:21:12,938
-I know you would have.
-But that was months ago.

268
00:21:13,605 --> 00:21:15,941
Now the only person
you're punishing is yourself.

269
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:21,738
Thank you for the coffee.

270
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,583
Hey, Curt.

271
00:21:35,460 --> 00:21:39,506
How often you think about it?
You know, the shit we did over there?

272
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,301
All the time.

273
00:21:42,593 --> 00:21:44,345
But my conscience is clear.

274
00:21:45,261 --> 00:21:48,849
Afghanistan... was different, you know?

275
00:21:49,808 --> 00:21:51,643
-Different how?
-Just different.

276
00:21:52,561 --> 00:21:55,605
Things we did, they...
they kinda got blurred.

277
00:21:57,524 --> 00:21:58,984
What were you into, Frank?

278
00:22:01,737 --> 00:22:04,614
-[sighs]
-You see, what worries me the most...

279
00:22:04,948 --> 00:22:08,076
is that you've been in a hole so long
that it's become home.

280
00:22:09,870 --> 00:22:12,163
Maybe that's where I'm supposed to be.

281
00:22:14,458 --> 00:22:17,419
Do me a favor, Frank.
Don't be a wallowing asshole.

282
00:22:17,503 --> 00:22:18,587
[scoffs]

283
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,465
Before I have to take this fake leg off
and beat you to death with it.

284
00:22:21,548 --> 00:22:23,049
[both laughing]

285
00:22:24,676 --> 00:22:26,052
Just imagine your tombstone.

286
00:22:26,136 --> 00:22:29,305
"Frank Castle lose a ass-kicking contest
to a one-legged man."

287
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:30,974
-I'd do it.
-Yeah.

288
00:22:31,057 --> 00:22:32,851
I'd actually kinda like to see that.

289
00:22:32,934 --> 00:22:34,686
Take care of yourself, Curt.

290
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,081
ID, please?

291
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:12,307
-[phone ringing]
-[elevator dings]

292
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:17,145
-[Sam]  So who was this guy to you?
-[Dinah]  Ahmad Zubair was my partner.

293
00:23:17,228 --> 00:23:19,481
He was taken from his home in Kandahar,
shot in the head,

294
00:23:19,564 --> 00:23:22,859
-and buried in an unmarked grave.
-[Sam]  That's quite a story.

295
00:23:23,234 --> 00:23:26,447
Doesn't bode well for me
as your newly assigned partner.

296
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:30,575
It's more than a story.
And Stein... we're not partners.

297
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,743
Sam.

298
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:36,039
-Stein sounds like a large beer glass.
-[scoffs]

299
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:39,460
And, uh, according to the assignments,
that's exactly what we are.

300
00:23:40,544 --> 00:23:41,795
Partners, I mean.

301
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:44,465
Sure, you're the lead agent
with a nice office

302
00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:46,800
and I'm the junior
with the shitty little desk outside,

303
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,969
but... partners nevertheless.

304
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:51,763
-Gotta earn my trust first.
-Yeah.

305
00:23:51,847 --> 00:23:53,724
That's exactly what I have to do.

306
00:23:53,807 --> 00:23:57,102
Your approval immediately being
the most important thing in my life.

307
00:23:58,812 --> 00:24:02,608
Madani, you really think Wolf
is gonna let you run with all this?

308
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:07,154
I'm confident I can persuade the SAC
of the case's merits.

309
00:24:07,529 --> 00:24:10,156
Well... I guess you are new here.

310
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,449
[knocking on door]

311
00:24:12,868 --> 00:24:13,827
Morning, sir.

312
00:24:13,910 --> 00:24:16,580
Back in the country three weeks,
and you already have a case for me.

313
00:24:16,663 --> 00:24:19,332
I brought this one back
from Afghanistan with me, sir.

314
00:24:19,415 --> 00:24:23,044
This man, Ahmad Zubair
of the Afghan National Police,

315
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:26,047
discovered United States soldiers
were trafficking heroin.

316
00:24:26,131 --> 00:24:27,674
And they killed him for it.

317
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,802
Stein, give us the room.

318
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,888
Sir, uh, as Madani's new partner,

319
00:24:32,971 --> 00:24:34,723
-shouldn't I--
-Close the door on your way out.

320
00:24:38,519 --> 00:24:39,603
You're lucky, Madani.

321
00:24:39,686 --> 00:24:42,313
A lot of people would give their left tit
for this job.

322
00:24:42,397 --> 00:24:45,859
I was happy where I was... tits intact.

323
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,110
Others weren't.

324
00:24:48,403 --> 00:24:52,032
The investigation you were pursuing
in Kandahar was deemed to serve no one.

325
00:24:52,365 --> 00:24:53,408
Deemed by who?

326
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:56,202
Frankly, you must have
a guardian angel, Madani.

327
00:24:56,286 --> 00:24:59,039
They pulled you out of there before
you did your career some real harm.

328
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,624
I guess you tick a lot of boxes,

329
00:25:00,707 --> 00:25:03,251
because they didn't want
the poster girl embarrassing them.

330
00:25:03,334 --> 00:25:05,170
[chuckles] Wow. That was sexist, racist,

331
00:25:05,253 --> 00:25:08,423
and demeaning of my abilities
all in one sentence, sir. Bravo.

332
00:25:08,506 --> 00:25:11,927
Well, sue me. It's your word against mine.
Kinda like your case here.

333
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:15,138
The US government gave Ahmad Zubair
our word, and it got him killed.

334
00:25:15,221 --> 00:25:17,641
A place like this,
who knows what got him killed?

335
00:25:17,724 --> 00:25:19,059
He could've been dirty.

336
00:25:19,976 --> 00:25:22,729
I was pulled out of Afghanistan
'cause something stunk to high heaven

337
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:25,065
and I was close
to finding out exactly what.

338
00:25:25,148 --> 00:25:26,608
And here you are.

339
00:25:26,692 --> 00:25:29,235
Now, I like tenacious
and energetic, Madani.

340
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:30,946
I find it kinda hot in a woman.

341
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:33,824
But I will not stand for insubordinate.
Are we clear?

342
00:25:33,907 --> 00:25:35,909
Ask your little buddy Stein about that.

343
00:25:36,534 --> 00:25:40,246
Now, Kandahar is off-limits.
Otherwise, you can quit.

344
00:25:42,916 --> 00:25:45,335
-You're the boss.
-Yes, I am.

345
00:25:48,505 --> 00:25:49,923
[hammering]

346
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:54,720
-[grunting]
-[men conversing indistinctly]

347
00:25:54,803 --> 00:25:56,346
[Leo] I need a drink.

348
00:25:56,429 --> 00:25:58,974
-[Paulie] Murphy's?
-[Scut] Maybe Rhonda will be working.

349
00:25:59,057 --> 00:26:00,684
Maybe this time you'll speak to her.

350
00:26:00,767 --> 00:26:03,144
-Like she'd notice.
-Bite me, dipshit.

351
00:26:03,228 --> 00:26:04,520
I could use a drink.

352
00:26:04,605 --> 00:26:06,648
[Frank continues grunting]

353
00:26:08,734 --> 00:26:09,776
Come on, Lance.

354
00:26:10,694 --> 00:26:13,154
Let me come with you guys.
Look, first round's on me.

355
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,823
-[all exclaiming]
-All right.

356
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:17,283
-Yeah, sure.
-[chuckles]

357
00:26:17,367 --> 00:26:19,661
Why not, huh? Why not?

358
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:22,372
[knocking on door]

359
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:34,134
-Good meeting with Wolf, huh?
-Peachy.

360
00:26:34,217 --> 00:26:36,803
As your immediate junior
in the chain of command...

361
00:26:37,721 --> 00:26:39,555
am I allowed to ask
how you're feeling about that?

362
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:41,557
How about you lay off
with the "junior" shit?

363
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:44,144
I can live without
your wiseass comments right now.

364
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:46,479
Not really sure what else I have to offer.

365
00:26:50,984 --> 00:26:53,611
You know how I knew
Wolf wouldn't want your case?

366
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:58,199
You got me for a partner.

367
00:27:00,326 --> 00:27:01,703
You're telling me this why?

368
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,789
You seem like a good person.

369
00:27:04,956 --> 00:27:08,126
Someone with a career in the department
if you really want one.

370
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,712
[scoffs] What did you do to piss him off?

371
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,717
You gotta earn my trust first.

372
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:18,011
[chuckles softly]

373
00:27:18,094 --> 00:27:19,220
So...

374
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:22,015
what now?

375
00:27:29,439 --> 00:27:31,399
Now I want you to get me whatever we have

376
00:27:31,482 --> 00:27:34,569
on a Marine Force Recon colonel
called Schoonover,

377
00:27:34,652 --> 00:27:37,238
the explosion and drug bust
at the 41st Street docks last year,

378
00:27:37,322 --> 00:27:39,783
and everything available
on one of his men,

379
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,492
Lieutenant Frank Castle.

380
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,955
The Punisher? He's dead.

381
00:27:46,247 --> 00:27:49,209
Castle and Schoonover
served in Afghanistan, same unit,

382
00:27:49,292 --> 00:27:52,838
then both are dead one day
and 20 miles apart...

383
00:27:52,921 --> 00:27:54,255
right here in New York.

384
00:27:55,465 --> 00:27:56,967
That strike you as a coincidence?

385
00:27:59,677 --> 00:28:02,638
-You're gonna run with this anyway?
-Do you have a problem with that?

386
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:06,434
No.

387
00:28:07,643 --> 00:28:09,437
I'm already on the shit pile.

388
00:28:11,231 --> 00:28:16,069
Just surprised a hotshot like you
is so eager to join me there.

389
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:21,199
Rhonda!

390
00:28:21,657 --> 00:28:25,161
Five more beers and...
and five more shots of that good stuff

391
00:28:25,245 --> 00:28:27,956
for me and my new pals here. [laughs]

392
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:30,583
Last round, and then I'm closing up.

393
00:28:30,666 --> 00:28:33,044
He pukes, you assholes are cleaning it up,
all right?

394
00:28:33,128 --> 00:28:35,380
You hear that? Keep it together, Donny.

395
00:28:35,463 --> 00:28:36,882
Hey. [clears throat]

396
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:39,760
I need to pull another job.

397
00:28:40,468 --> 00:28:44,723
I got this... Gnucci loan shark.
This guy's up my ass.

398
00:28:44,806 --> 00:28:48,643
Prick is threatening to break my legs,
take my car, the whole thing.

399
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,061
[chuckles]

400
00:28:51,687 --> 00:28:54,024
-[sighs]
-Man, what were you thinking?

401
00:28:54,107 --> 00:28:56,317
What were you thinking
taking money off those guys?

402
00:28:56,401 --> 00:28:58,361
What'd you think was gonna happen?

403
00:28:58,444 --> 00:28:59,821
You got something for me or not?

404
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:02,741
-[sighs] Thanks, Rhonda.
-Yeah.

405
00:29:02,824 --> 00:29:05,201
Yeah, all right.
Just take it easy, man, okay? I'll, uh...

406
00:29:06,453 --> 00:29:09,497
I'll call my cousin. All right?
See if he can hook us up again.

407
00:29:09,956 --> 00:29:12,918
-Soon, Paulie. Soon.
-Yeah. Okay. All right. All right. Okay.

408
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:14,335
I'll call him tonight, all right?

409
00:29:14,419 --> 00:29:16,212
-[Donny chuckles] Whoa.
-[Scut] Whoa!

410
00:29:16,296 --> 00:29:17,588
[Leo] Keep it together, Donny.

411
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,008
-The state of this guy, man.
-[Leo] She's looking, man.

412
00:29:20,091 --> 00:29:21,802
[Leo and Scut laughing]

413
00:29:21,885 --> 00:29:22,928
Your check.

414
00:29:24,595 --> 00:29:25,806
[scoffs]

415
00:29:27,265 --> 00:29:28,474
Pay the lady.

416
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,520
What? You said you were buying, right?

417
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:37,609
[sighs]

418
00:29:42,405 --> 00:29:43,406
Yeah. Yeah.

419
00:29:43,489 --> 00:29:44,950
-[Paulie chuckles]
-All right.

420
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:47,410
-[Scut] Yeah!
-[Leo] Heck, yeah!

421
00:29:47,493 --> 00:29:49,495
-[Leo] I knew you were buying.
-[Scut] Big bucks.

422
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:02,300
-Hey, sleepyhead.
-[Frank gasps softly]

423
00:30:02,383 --> 00:30:03,885
-[Frank] Hey.
-Hi.

424
00:30:03,969 --> 00:30:05,428
[Frank chuckles]

425
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,895
-What time is it?
-It's 10:30.

426
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,271
[Frank chuckles]

427
00:30:16,356 --> 00:30:17,941
You needed your sleep.

428
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:19,525
Yeah.

429
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:21,903
There's plenty of time
now that you're home.

430
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,196
[gasps]

431
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:30,286
[sighs]

432
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:35,125
[Paulie] My cousin came through big time.

433
00:30:35,208 --> 00:30:37,210
[Lance] All right. All right.
What's the job, huh?

434
00:30:37,293 --> 00:30:39,337
[Paulie] It's a poker game. High stakes.

435
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,965
-Fifty, maybe even seventy grand.
-[Lance exhales heavily]

436
00:30:42,048 --> 00:30:44,843
[Paulie] I know. I know.
They got a "no guns at the table" rule.

437
00:30:44,926 --> 00:30:48,138
Except for one guard standing at the door.
We go in...

438
00:30:48,721 --> 00:30:51,557
we take out the guard,
the two of us cover the room.

439
00:30:51,641 --> 00:30:54,686
One of us scoops up the cash,
and one outside in the car.

440
00:30:55,103 --> 00:30:58,481
[scoffs] What's the catch?
Why isn't someone hitting this every week?

441
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,985
[laughs] It's protected by the Gnuccis.

442
00:31:02,735 --> 00:31:03,987
-[laughing]
-Are you crazy?

443
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:05,655
You want to hit an outfit game?

444
00:31:05,738 --> 00:31:08,699
-I don't know, Paulie. Paulie, this is--
-[Paulie] Hey. Don't be a pussy.

445
00:31:08,783 --> 00:31:11,161
And besides, I thought...

446
00:31:11,244 --> 00:31:15,290
you'd like the idea of paying back
the Gnuccis' shylock with his own cash.

447
00:31:15,373 --> 00:31:16,917
-Yeah, I do.
-There we go.

448
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,543
-I do.
-Attaboy. Attaboy.

449
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:20,378
-All right.
-[Frank sips loudly]

450
00:31:22,213 --> 00:31:23,214
Who's that?

451
00:31:25,050 --> 00:31:26,176
Look who it is...

452
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,096
-[Paulie sighs heavily]
-Captain Batshit.

453
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:32,765
Were you listening to us?

454
00:31:34,059 --> 00:31:35,060
Hmm?

455
00:31:35,643 --> 00:31:36,644
Hmm?

456
00:31:36,727 --> 00:31:39,564
Everywhere I turn,
there you are, pissing me off.

457
00:31:41,691 --> 00:31:42,901
Now, you...

458
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:46,654
you need to mind your own business.

459
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:50,033
[Paulie] Putting your nose
where it don't belong, huh?

460
00:31:50,741 --> 00:31:52,160
What?

461
00:31:52,243 --> 00:31:53,995
What? What do you wanna do?

462
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,080
Huh?

463
00:31:56,456 --> 00:31:57,540
What do you wanna do?

464
00:31:59,084 --> 00:32:00,710
Whoa, where you goin'? Where you goin'?

465
00:32:00,793 --> 00:32:01,836
Oh, where you goin'?

466
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,549
You're gonna get hurt, gimp.

467
00:32:10,178 --> 00:32:11,554
Oh.

468
00:32:11,637 --> 00:32:14,349
Oh, you wanna do something
with that hammer?

469
00:32:14,432 --> 00:32:16,434
Huh? You wanna... You wanna do something?

470
00:32:16,517 --> 00:32:18,519
What do you wanna do? You wanna take me?

471
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,480
I'm right here.

472
00:32:20,563 --> 00:32:22,398
I ain't going anywhere.

473
00:32:22,482 --> 00:32:25,151
And I will mess you up
without breaking a sweat.

474
00:32:25,235 --> 00:32:27,278
Are we clear on that? Huh?

475
00:32:28,404 --> 00:32:31,074
Yeah, you better stay out of my way,

476
00:32:31,157 --> 00:32:33,576
or that hammer's gonna find
a new home up your ass.

477
00:32:33,659 --> 00:32:36,454
-[chuckles]
-Do you understand?

478
00:32:38,414 --> 00:32:40,541
-[man in the distance] Yeah, that's it.
-Huh?

479
00:32:40,625 --> 00:32:42,627
-[men shouting]
-[metal clanging]

480
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:44,504
-[man screaming]
-[metal clattering]

481
00:32:44,587 --> 00:32:46,672
-[Lance] Shit!
-[men continue shouting]

482
00:32:47,423 --> 00:32:50,051
[Scut groaning loudly]

483
00:32:51,719 --> 00:32:53,096
[man] Call somebody. Hurry up!

484
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:55,473
[continues groaning]

485
00:32:56,724 --> 00:32:58,809
Jesus! You can see the bone!

486
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,478
[man] All right. Call an ambulance.

487
00:33:00,561 --> 00:33:01,771
You were in the Marines, right?

488
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:04,607
You must know first aid or field medicine
or something! Come on!

489
00:33:10,613 --> 00:33:12,073
[Scut crying]

490
00:33:17,412 --> 00:33:19,330
We gotta cancel tonight.

491
00:33:19,414 --> 00:33:21,957
No, man.
My cousin will think we pussied out.

492
00:33:22,042 --> 00:33:24,377
-[sighs]
-I thought you needed the money.

493
00:33:25,211 --> 00:33:27,838
-I do.
-Then let's do it, huh?

494
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,632
We got nothing to worry about.
Don't worry.

495
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,639
-Hey. Hey, hey...
-[Paulie] Hmm?

496
00:33:36,722 --> 00:33:39,350
-What about him?
-Him?

497
00:33:39,434 --> 00:33:42,062
-You can't be serious.
-What? He's no virgin.

498
00:33:42,145 --> 00:33:44,897
-Hey, Donny. Come here.
-[Paulie sighs]

499
00:33:44,980 --> 00:33:46,441
[Donny clears throat]

500
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:52,697
-That was messed up, huh?
-Yeah, shitty luck. For him, for us.

501
00:33:53,781 --> 00:33:56,826
Hey, look, we got a thing tonight.
Make us some real money.

502
00:33:56,909 --> 00:34:00,580
But... Scut going down
has left us a man short.

503
00:34:00,663 --> 00:34:03,958
I ain't gonna lie to you, Donny.
This ain't exactly... legal.

504
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:06,544
-You got the balls for it?
-Hey, man, I got plenty of balls.

505
00:34:06,627 --> 00:34:08,421
I don't doubt it. So you in?

506
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:13,593
-No, man. I need to know more about it.
-[Paulie] Nah. You're in or you're not.

507
00:34:13,676 --> 00:34:17,805
[Lance] Serious money, hour's work.
Huh? You'd be doing us a solid.

508
00:34:19,014 --> 00:34:20,141
[sighs] Yeah.

509
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,393
-All right, I'll help you out.
-[Lance] All right.

-One of the boys.
-He's growing up.

512
00:34:25,563 --> 00:34:27,482
[Lance] All right,
help us clean this shit up.

513
00:34:28,483 --> 00:34:29,734
All right, over here.

514

515
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,670
[Farah] Why is it that you resent
being home so much, do you think?

516
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:53,633
I resent being forced to come back.
I resent that no one is hiding that fact.

517
00:34:53,716 --> 00:34:56,802
Mostly, I...
I resent that no one wants the truth.

518
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,848
I just want you to be sure
that this case of yours isn't just a way

519
00:35:00,931 --> 00:35:03,559
to avoid dealing with losing someone
you were close to.

520
00:35:03,643 --> 00:35:06,437
I didn't lose anyone. They killed him.

521
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:09,774
I told Ahmad he could trust us.

522
00:35:11,234 --> 00:35:12,693
Told him he could trust me.

523
00:35:16,864 --> 00:35:19,367
How much are you drinking these days?

524
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:22,412
[sighs] Jesus, Mom. Now and then.

525
00:35:22,495 --> 00:35:25,790
Maybe more now I'm home and have access
to your $100 a bottle stuff.

526
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,877
I know your heart is in the right place,
but I don't need therapy.

527
00:35:30,295 --> 00:35:32,255
Definitely not from you. No offense.

528
00:35:33,256 --> 00:35:34,507
None taken.

529
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:37,260
That. That right there.

530
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:39,929
That is why therapy
would never work for me.

531
00:35:40,012 --> 00:35:41,139
Talking to you is like...

532
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:43,474
It's like interviewing a suspect
you know has the answers

533
00:35:43,558 --> 00:35:44,892
and just smiles in your face.

534
00:35:44,975 --> 00:35:49,147
That's not about being a psychiatrist.
It's about being your mother.

535
00:35:49,230 --> 00:35:50,398
[sighs]

536
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:53,108
Nice to have you back.

537
00:35:57,738 --> 00:35:59,740
Nice to share this with you.

538
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:03,369
It's temporary.

539
00:36:04,745 --> 00:36:06,497
Just till I find a place.

540
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:14,130
Every night, I drink a glass of wine
over dinner with your father.

541
00:36:15,047 --> 00:36:16,757
He usually pours it for me.

542
00:36:17,633 --> 00:36:21,387
And not once in almost 40 years
has he joined me.

543
00:36:22,388 --> 00:36:25,141
His faith is as strong as my lack of it.

544
00:36:25,641 --> 00:36:30,355
I sometimes ask him,
"How can a surgeon believe in God?"

545
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,274
He says he would go mad

546
00:36:33,358 --> 00:36:37,069
if he couldn't see some kind
of guiding principle in the world.

547
00:36:38,196 --> 00:36:41,324
I have faith in a system. Our system.

548
00:36:41,407 --> 00:36:45,411
The one that took you and Dad in
and made you wealthy and respected.

549
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:48,498
This country gave us freedom.

550
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:52,543
But it's fragile. It needs protection.

551
00:36:54,504 --> 00:36:56,839
Your father's faith in God doesn't mean

552
00:36:56,922 --> 00:36:59,467
that he cannot see the flaws
in his religion.

553
00:37:00,301 --> 00:37:02,762
Why don't you tell me what it is
you're trying to say, Mom?

554
00:37:04,847 --> 00:37:09,477
This case of yours is heresy, Dinah.
You've been told as much.

555
00:37:10,478 --> 00:37:12,313
What you're doing scares me.

556
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:17,151
